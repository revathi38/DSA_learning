Groot has a profound love for palindrome which is why he keeps fooling around with strings.
A palindrome string is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

Given a string A of size N consisting of lowercase alphabets, he wants to know if it is possible to make the given string a palindrome by changing exactly one of its character.
